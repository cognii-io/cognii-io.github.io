Have you ever wondered what's *really* going on in people's minds when they make decisions? That's exactly what we have been doing for more than 10 years at cognii — but we didn't just settle for wondering. We have been applying neuroscience, neurotesting, and analyzing billions of data points to actually understand and uncover the hidden drivers behind unconscious human decision making.

## A Heritage Reboot of Neurons

Cognii was founded by Thomas Z. Ramsøy. If that name rings a bell, it might just be because he founded the hugely successful Neurons back in 2013. Neurons was originally an applied neuroscience consultancy, but in recent years, breakthroughs in predicting human reactions to advertising led to Neurons pivoting to become a full-fledged AI SaaS scale-up — leaving the consultancy part behind. Cognii has now picked up that torch.

So despite being founded in 2025, cognii stands on the shoulders of and continues the work done previously under the Neurons brand as a heritage reboot of the consultancy division. We're simply going back to our roots of trailblazing customer understanding across domains through applying neuroscience. 

## A New Approach

Cognii is by design agile, nimble, and global. Preferring a small core team with a select number of global freelancers over building a larger consultancy organization, we ensure that you get the very best — every time. This does, however, naturally limit the number of potential clients we choose to work with, but we are always open to discussing projects and problems, because, quite frankly, we simply love uncovering new and previously unattainable insights into human decision making.
