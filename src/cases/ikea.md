When IKEA decided to enter the renewable energy market, they faced a critical challenge: would customers accept and understand this expansion beyond their traditional home furnishing offerings? To answer this question, IKEA partnered with us to implement an innovative research approach called NeuroPrototyping.

NeuroPrototyping, a methodology developed through collaboration with Lowe's Home Improvement, combines eye-tracking and brain monitoring to measure subconscious responses to new products and services. This approach was particularly relevant for understanding how customers would respond to environmental products, as green decisions represent what researchers call "intertemporal choices" â€“ decisions that require trading current costs for future benefits.

The research team conducted a comprehensive study across two distinct markets: the Netherlands and Poland. With over 30 participants in each country (average age 37.1 years), the study revealed fascinating insights into how different markets perceive renewable energy offerings. While Dutch consumers generally aligned with global trends in renewable energy interest, Polish consumers showed notably lower engagement levels.

The study's findings highlighted several crucial factors for market entry. Each country demonstrated clear preferences, but interestingly, there was often a disconnect between conscious and subconscious responses to the concepts presented. Product titles proved to be particularly influential in shaping customer perceptions, and visual scanning patterns provided valuable insights into the decision-making process.

Perhaps most significantly, the research revealed substantial variations between the Dutch and Polish markets in how they received different concepts. This finding led to a key strategic insight: IKEA would need to develop market-specific approaches for both their product offerings and communication strategies. The success of their renewable energy products would depend on carefully balancing rational arguments with emotional appeals, tailored to each market's unique characteristics.

Armed with these insights, IKEA could move forward with confidence, knowing they had a clear understanding of how to position their renewable energy offerings in each market. The research not only confirmed market potential but also provided a roadmap for how to communicate effectively with customers in different regions, ensuring their expansion into the energy sector would resonate with their target audience.
